## Objective

Open cards one at-a-time, seeking to match the card icons in the shortest time and with the fewest moves possible.  Success is indicated with a timer, move counter, and 3-star rating system.

3 stars rates an exceptionally low number of moves to match all cards.

2 stars indicates an average number of moves was required to match all cards.

1 star indicates you might want to play again for a better rating.
